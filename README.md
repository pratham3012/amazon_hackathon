# Amazon ML Hackathon 
Date : 30 July - 1 Aug 2021

Amazon catalog consists of billions of products that belong to thousands of browse nodes (each browse node represents a collection of items for sale). Browse nodes are used to help customer navigate through our website and classify products to product type groups. Hence, it is important to predict the node assignment at the time of listing of the product or when the browse node information is absent.

For each PRODUCT_ID in the test data set, we provided a browse node id prediction.
